# WiFi Pineapple nano and tetra wps module fixed
The wps module for the WiFi Pineapple nano and tetra. It has been edited to run properly on the latest firmwares.  Thanks to Whistle Master for the original and adde88 for the updated reaver, bully, and pixiewps ipks.

After pressing the install dependencies button you may choose to delete the ipks to free up space if needed. ipks are stored in "/pineapple/modules/wps/ipks/" or "/sd/modules/wps/ipks/" depending on where you chose to install.
